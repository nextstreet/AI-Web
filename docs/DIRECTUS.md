# Directus publishing CMS

Directus is the editorial publishing backend. Supabase remains the durable source
for tenant membership, topic graphs, candidates, briefs, and performance data.
Moving a candidate to `published` in Supabase does not create a public page, and
Directus only exposes records that an editor has explicitly moved to `published`.

Astro reads Directus at build time. Publishing therefore requires a site rebuild:
configure a Directus Flow that sends a `POST` request to the hosting provider's
deploy hook when a record in one of the collections below changes to
`published`. A CMS outage cannot affect an already deployed static site.

## Local self-hosted instance

The repository ships a Docker-based instance under `directus/` (requires Docker):

```bash
cd directus
cp .env.example .env   # generate KEY/SECRET and set ADMIN_* values
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec directus directus schema apply ./snapshots/2026-10-02-cms.yaml
```

The snapshot is the canonical, version-controlled data model: four collections,
their fields, and the page-to-blocks relation. After applying it, create the
read policy described below, then optionally load deterministic development
content:

```powershell
$env:DIRECTUS_ADMIN_TOKEN = "an admin static token"
node directus/seed/seed.mjs
```

## Required collections

All four collections are regular collections rather than global singletons so
that every record retains `tenant_id`. Use UUID primary keys and require the
fields marked **required**.

### `cms_sites`

| Field | Directus type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | UUID | Primary key |
| `tenant_id` | String or UUID | **Required**, unique together with `status` for published rows |
| `status` | String | **Required**; `draft`, `review`, `published`, or `archived` |
| `site_name` | String | **Required**, replaces the header brand and title suffix |
| `footer_text` | Text | **Required**, replaces the global footer |

### `cms_navigation`

| Field | Directus type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | UUID | Primary key |
| `tenant_id` | String or UUID | **Required** |
| `status` | String | **Required**; use the same lifecycle choices |
| `location` | String | **Required**; currently `header` |
| `label` | String | **Required** |
| `url` | String | **Required**; internal path or absolute URL |
| `open_in_new_tab` | Boolean | Default `false` |
| `sort` | Integer | Controls visual order |

### `cms_pages`

| Field | Directus type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | UUID | Primary key |
| `tenant_id` | String or UUID | **Required** |
| `status` | String | **Required**; `draft`, `review`, `published`, or `archived` |
| `path` | String | **Required**; canonical path such as `/guides/example/` |
| `page_type` | String | **Required**; one of the page types defined by the product model |
| `title` | String | **Required**, visible H1 |
| `seo_title` | String | Optional search title; falls back to `title` |
| `description` | Text | **Required**, meta description and summary |
| `eyebrow` | String | Optional label above the H1 |
| `lead` | Text | Optional introductory copy |
| `body_html` | WYSIWYG | Legacy free-form body; only rendered when a page has no blocks |
| `blocks` | One-to-many → `cms_blocks` | Structured content blocks, the primary editing surface |
| `primary_topic` | String | Optional human-readable topic |
| `topic_id` | String | Optional stable topic identifier |
| `related_topic_ids` | JSON | Array of stable topic identifiers |
| `published_at` | DateTime | Optional structured-data publication date |
| `date_updated` | DateTime | Directus update timestamp |
| `noindex` | Boolean | Default `false`; emits `noindex, nofollow` |

### `cms_blocks`

Blocks belong to one `cms_pages` item through a required `page` field and are
ordered by `sort`. The `block_type` discriminates which fields are used; the
Astro build normalizes every row through the Zod contract in
`packages/shared/src/cms-blocks.ts` and rejects invalid blocks.

| Field | Directus type | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | UUID | Primary key |
| `tenant_id` | String or UUID | **Required**; must match the parent page tenant |
| `sort` | Integer | Visual order |
| `page` | Many-to-one → `cms_pages` | **Required** parent page |
| `block_type` | String | **Required**; see block types below |
| `heading` | String | `heading`, `comparison`, `cta` |
| `body` | WYSIWYG | `text`, `cta` |
| `items` | JSON (list) | `options`, `steps`, `faq`, `comparison` |
| `cta_label` | String | `cta` button label |
| `cta_url` | String | `cta` target path or URL |

Block types and their `items` row shape:

| Block type | Row fields | Structured data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `heading` | — | — |
| `text` | — | — |
| `options` | `label`, `detail` | — |
| `steps` | `name`, `text` | `HowTo` + `HowToStep` |
| `faq` | `question`, `answer` | `FAQPage` + `Question` |
| `comparison` | `dimension`, `difference` | — |
| `cta` | — (`heading`, `body`, `cta_label`, `cta_url`) | — |

Create a unique database constraint on `(tenant_id, path)`. Configure the item
editor so `draft -> review -> published` is the normal path; generated drafts
must not default to `published`. The home page uses `/`. `/custom/` and
`/guides/` replace their existing landing copy while retaining the automatic
content cards. `/studio/` remains a developer route and cannot be replaced by
CMS content.

`body_html` and block `body` fields are rendered as trusted editorial HTML.
Limit write access to trusted editors, disable script-capable markup in the
WYSIWYG configuration, and do not grant anonymous users create/update
permissions.

### `cms_product_categories` and `cms_products`

Product catalog content is also editorial content and is managed in Directus.
Both collections require `tenant_id` and use the same `draft -> review ->
published -> archived` lifecycle. A product is visible only when its own status
is `published`; category assignment is optional but published products should
normally belong to a published category.

`cms_products` owns the product name, summary, category, starting price, currency,
lead time, image reference, feature list, and specification list. Astro renders
the catalog at `/products/`, product detail pages at `/products/{slug}/`, and a
catalog section on `/custom/`. Directus file IDs are converted to `/assets/{id}`
URLs at build time; external HTTPS image URLs are also supported.

## Editorial operating plan

1. Create or edit site settings and navigation in `cms_sites` and
   `cms_navigation`.
2. Create page copy in `cms_pages` and its ordered `cms_blocks`; keep generated
   drafts in `draft` until an editor checks facts, links, and markup.
3. Create product categories first, then product records with factual features,
   specifications, images, price assumptions, and lead time.
4. Move each item through `review` and then `published` only after human review.
5. Configure a Directus Flow to call the hosting deploy hook when a published
   `cms_sites`, `cms_navigation`, `cms_pages`, `cms_blocks`,
   `cms_product_categories`, or `cms_products` item changes.
6. Verify the rebuilt `/`, `/products/`, `/products/{slug}/`, `/custom/`, and
   `/guides/` pages plus the sitemap before treating the change as live.

Directus is not the source for SEO candidates, topic graphs, briefs, or
performance metrics. Those remain tenant-scoped operational data in Supabase.

## Read access and environment

After applying the snapshot, create a **Static site reader** policy with
read-only item permissions on all four collections (`cms_sites`,
`cms_navigation`, `cms_pages`, `cms_blocks`), then issue a static token for a
user bound to that policy. It must never be exposed as a `PUBLIC_*` variable.
The build also applies `tenant_id` and `status=published` filters itself.

```dotenv
DIRECTUS_URL="http://localhost:8055"
DIRECTUS_TOKEN="read-only-static-token"
DIRECTUS_TENANT_ID="ita-bag-lab"
```

If public read permissions are intentionally configured, `DIRECTUS_TOKEN` may
be omitted. If all Directus variables are omitted, local reviewed Markdown and
the repository's default navigation remain active. Partial configuration fails
the build so a deployment cannot silently publish the wrong source.

Before enabling a deployment, create one published `cms_sites` row and the
desired `cms_navigation` rows for the configured tenant. Then create a draft
page, move it through review, publish it, trigger the deploy hook, and verify the
canonical URL in the generated sitemap.
