# AI Development Instructions

This file is the entry point for Codex CLI, Trae agents, and other coding agents.

## Read first

Before changing architecture, database schema, content lifecycle, or SEO logic, read:

1. `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`
2. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. `docs/DECISIONS.md`
4. The README in the package being changed

For database work, also read `docs/DATABASE.md`. For task status, read
`docs/CURRENT-SPRINT.md`.

## Non-negotiable rules

- Preserve `tenant_id` on tenant-owned data and queries.
- Keep candidate opportunities separate from published pages.
- Treat SEO as `topic/query -> intent -> page type -> brief -> page`, not
  `keyword -> article`.
- Keep industry-specific Ita Bag data out of reusable core packages.
- Put every database change in `supabase/migrations/`.
- Never expose service-role keys in browser code.
- Do not auto-publish generated content. V1 requires review.
- Do not add major infrastructure or dependencies without a concrete need.
- Preserve user changes and make the smallest coherent patch.

## Package boundaries

This repository is the self-use site project only. The customer delivery kit
(Directus + n8n) lives in a separate repository and must not be wired back here.

- `apps/web`: self-use Astro presentation, page rendering, and thin wiring.
- `apps/cms`: self-use Payload content model, migrations, and admin.
- `packages/seo-engine`: whether to create, expand, merge, or ignore.
- `packages/content-engine`: how an approved page should be briefed/created.
- `packages/shared`: types, schemas, constants, and generic utilities only.
- `supabase`: durable schema, RLS, migrations, and seed data for this project.

## Definition of done

Before reporting completion, run from repository root:

```bash
pnpm check
```

If a command cannot run, report the exact reason. Summarize changed files,
schema changes, tests performed, unfinished work, and risks.

## Task prompt template

```text
Read AGENTS.md and the referenced docs first.

Task:
<one bounded outcome>

Requirements:
